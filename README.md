# theoretical-blockchain-research-papers

A list of research papers on theoretical/mathematical aspects of blockchain or ML related ones on blockchain.

The following classifications are neither correct or mutual exclusive. As of the first commit to this repository,
the research community on the theory of blockchain is much smaller compared to the other active research fields such as Machine learning. 

> However, little work has been done on basic theory of blockchain systems so far, for example, developing mathematical models (e.g., optimal methods, Markov processes, queueing theory and game models), providing performance analysis and optimization, and setting up useful relations among key factors or basic parameters. â€” Li, Quan-Lin, Jing-Yu Ma, and Yan-Xia Chang. "Blockchain Queueing Theory." arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.01795 (2018).
